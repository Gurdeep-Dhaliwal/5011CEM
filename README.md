## Scenario

In this project we were tasked with speeding up the processing time required to process climate model data. Where currently it requires 2.5 hours to process 1 hour of data from the climate model, which means it would take 60 hours to process a day's data from the climate model. We wish to decrease this processing time to 2 hours for all data for a 24 hour period (25 data sets) from the climate model.

This was solved by using parallel and sequential processing.

## Code

This Project goes to compare the processing speeds of parallel and sequential processing , big data techniques, and see how may workers/processors would be require to meet the scenarios conditions. It does this by creating graphs of comparision between the two processing methods and gives a recomendation infered from the graphs produced.
